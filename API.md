GeoServer provides several Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that conform to Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, enabling users to interact with geospatial data in various ways. Here’s an overview of the primary APIs provided by GeoServer:

1. **Web Map Service (WMS)**:
   - **Description**: WMS is a standard protocol that allows users to request and receive dynamically generated map images of spatially referenced data.
   - **Use Case**: It is commonly used for rendering maps from geospatial datasets, enabling visualization of spatial data layers on web platforms.

2. **Web Feature Service (WFS)**:
   - **Description**: WFS provides an interface for accessing geospatial features over the web. Unlike WMS, which returns images, WFS returns actual data about geographic features in a format like GML, JSON, or XML.
   - **Use Case**: It allows users to query, download, and manipulate geospatial feature data directly.

3. **Web Coverage Service (WCS)**:
   - **Description**: WCS offers a means to receive geospatial coverage data (e.g., raster data), allowing access to complex grid data.
   - **Use Case**: WCS is ideal for scenarios where users need raw data for analysis, such as satellite imagery or digital elevation models.

4. **Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)**:
   - **Description**: WMTS provides a protocol for serving pre-rendered geospatial maps as tiles, which enhances server performance by caching tiles that can be reused.
   - **Use Case**: It’s mainly used for applications requiring fast map loading times and seamless navigation, like online mapping services.

5. **Web Processing Service (WPS)**:
   - **Description**: WPS defines a standardized interface that allows users to request geospatial processing services spatially or thematically.
   - **Use Case**: It is used to perform spatial data processing on the server, such as computations, transformations, or data conversion.

6. **Web Map Context Documents (WMC)**:
   - **Description**: WMC allows users to encapsulate all necessary parameters to reproduce a map view, including layers, styles, and spatial extent.
   - **Use Case**: Its primary use is in maintaining map configurations for sharing or re-using specific map setups.

7. **Filter Encoding Specification (FES)**:
   - **Description**: FES is used in conjunction with WFS to define filters for querying geospatial datasets.
   - **Use Case**: It allows users to perform complex queries on geospatial data, such as finding features based on attribute conditions or spatial constraints.

These APIs are needed for integrating GeoServer with various client applications, enabling a wide range of geospatial operations from simple map viewing to complex spatial analyses and data retrieval tasks. Each API serves a specific role in handling different types of geospatial data and operations, supporting interoperability and flexibility in geospatial applications.

# Supported API Programming Languages, libraries and SDKs 

Here's a list of programming libraries, modules, or SDKs in Python (and alternative languages if applicable) that support the various APIs offered by GeoServer:

1. **Web Map Service (WMS)**:
   - **Python**: 
     - **`owslib`**: This library provides a way to work with OGC web services, including WMS, directly from Python.
     - **`folium`**: This is a library for visualizing geospatial data that can pull tiles from WMS.
   - **Alternative**: JavaScript using libraries like OpenLayers or Leaflet can also work with WMS services.

2. **Web Feature Service (WFS)**:
   - **Python**: 
     - **`owslib`**: It supports WFS, allowing users to interact with and query features from a WFS server.
     - **`fiona`**: While primarily used for reading/writing geospatial data files, it can also open WFS-like URLs through GDAL.
   - **Alternative**: JavaScript libraries like OpenLayers have built-in support for WFS services.

3. **Web Coverage Service (WCS)**:
   - **Python**:
     - **`owslib`**: It supports WCS, providing the ability to interact with coverage services.
   - **Alternative**: R, with packages like `stars`, can work with WCS services.

4. **Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)**:
   - **Python**:
     - **`owslib`**: Although less commonly used for WMTS, it still provides some level of support.
   - **Alternative**: JavaScript libraries such as OpenLayers and Leaflet for handling WMTS tilesets.

5. **Web Processing Service (WPS)**:
   - **Python**:
     - **`owslib`**: It includes capabilities to interact with WPS servers, allowing for process discovery and execution.
   - **Alternative**: Java can be used with the `geotools` library for more complex interactions with WPS.

6. **Web Map Context Documents (WMC)**:
   - **Python**:
     - **Manual handling with XML parsing libraries**: There's no dedicated library, but XML libraries in Python can parse and manipulate WMC documents.
   - **Alternative**: Tools like QGIS have native support for WMC files, which can be used via plugins or scripts.

7. **Filter Encoding Specification (FES)**:
   - **Python**:
     - **`owslib`**: Supports FES to some extent, allowing querying of geospatial data using filters.
   - **Alternative**: Java with `geotools` can be used for extensive FES support.

* These libraries facilitate easy interaction with GeoServer's API endpoints, enabling developers to integrate geospatial services into their applications.
* Note that `owslib` covers most of the APIs, however a key API for WMC is dependent on parsing and creation of XML documents.
