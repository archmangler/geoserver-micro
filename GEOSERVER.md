# What is Geoserver?

* GeoServer is an open source server application designed for sharing, processing, and editing geospatial data. Here are some of the primary use cases for GeoServer:

* 1. **Web Mapping Services**: GeoServer allows users to publish geospatial data as web services, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive maps. It supports protocols like Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Feature Service (WFS), which are standard for serving geospatial data over the internet.

* 2. **Data Access and Distribution**: Organizations can use GeoServer to distribute geospatial data to a wide audience, providing easy access to geographical information. It supports a variety of data formats and can handle large volumes of spatial data efficiently.

* 3. **Interoperability and Integration**: GeoServer acts as a middleware to integrate different GIS systems by supporting numerous data formats such as Shapefiles, GeoTIFF, KML, GML, and databases like PostGIS. This makes it easier to work with data from different sources and support GIS interoperability.

* 4. **Geospatial Analysis and Processing**: Although GeoServer itself is not primarily an analysis tool, it can be integrated with tools that do geospatial analysis. Users can leverage it to serve processed geospatial data derived from analyses performed in external tools or scripts.

* 5. **Real-Time Data Serving**: GeoServer is capable of serving real-time data. It can be used in applications requiring live updating maps, such as monitoring environmental data, tracking assets, or displaying current traffic conditions.

* 6. **Mobile and Client Applications**: Developers use GeoServer as a backend service to feed geospatial data to mobile and desktop applications. By serving data in multiple formats, it supports a wide range of clients, including web browsers, mobile apps, and GIS software.

* 7. **Customization and Styling**: Users can customize the appearance of their data using Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) and Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) styling capabilities. This allows for map layers to be styled with specific symbologies to enhance visualization.

* 8. **Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)**: GeoServer can be a core component in building an SDI which facilitates the sharing of spatial data across multiple departments or organizations, improving efficiency in storing, retrieving, and managing geospatial data.

* 9. **Collaborative GIS Projects**: In collaborative project environments, GeoServer can be used to manage and serve geospatial data for various stakeholders, enabling concurrent access to updated data and maps.

* 10. **Rapid Prototyping**: Developers and researchers can use GeoServer for rapid prototyping of geospatial applications, testing various datasets and outputs without the need to invest in expensive proprietary systems.

These use cases demonstrate GeoServer’s versatility and effectiveness in managing and delivering geospatial information across various sectors including urban planning, environmental monitoring, transportation, and agriculture, among others.

# Adoption and User-base

* GeoServer is a widely used platform for publishing geospatial data and is part of numerous public projects and initiatives worldwide. Some notable public projects and organizations utilizing GeoServer include:

* 1. **European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel Hub**: This service integrates GeoServer to provide access to satellite imagery from the Copernicus program, part of the European Union's Earth observation initiative. It offers APIs to facilitate the retrieval and processing of satellite data.

* 2. **US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer**: GeoServer is used in the Earth Explorer portal for serving a wide array of satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and cartographic maps, supporting researchers and the general public in accessing geospatial data.

* 3. **Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS)**: GeoServer is used within GEOSS, an international effort to build a comprehensive and coordinated Earth observation network, allowing for the sharing and integration of global geospatial data.

* 4. **The Government of Canada’s Federal Geospatial Platform (FGP)**: This platform utilizes GeoServer to host and provide access to national geospatial data, supporting various governmental departments and public access to geographic information.

* 5. **Natural Earth**: An initiative offering free public domain map data widely used by cartographers, geographers, GIS specialists, and users needing geographic data in vector format, relies on GeoServer for data hosting and access.

* 6. **INSPIRE Directive of the European Union**: This directive requires member states to make their spatial data interoperable and accessible. GeoServer is one of the tools used by various member states to comply with these requirements by publishing spatial datasets and services.

* 7. **OpenStreetMap (OSM) contributors**: Some contributors and regional outlets of the OSM community use GeoServer to serve map data, integrating it with other tools for enhanced map rendering and data dissemination.

* 8. **City of Portland, Oregon**: The city employs GeoServer to serve its geographic information system (GIS) data, enhancing public access and transparency regarding urban planning and infrastructure data.
GeoServer is used in various public projects worldwide, extending beyond Europe and North America. Some examples of major projects outside these regions include:

* 9. **Australian Geoscience Data Cube**: Part of the Digital Earth Australia initiative, this project uses GeoServer to provide access to satellite data and analysis-ready data products that support environmental monitoring, resource management, and policy-making.

* 10. **India's National Data and Analytics Platform (NDAP)**: GeoServer is utilized to integrate and provide access to a wide range of Indian government datasets, improving transparency and supporting informed decision-making for planning and development.

* 11. **Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE)**: INPE uses GeoServer to host and disseminate spatial data for environmental monitoring and research in the Amazon rainforest and other critical biomes.

* 12. **Kenya’s Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Cooperatives**: GeoServer is used to manage and distribute geospatial data related to agricultural resources, supporting improved resource management and planning.

* 13. **South Africa’s Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)**: Various government departments in South Africa utilize GeoServer to comply with SDI initiatives, which standardize and facilitate access to spatial data across different sectors.

* 14. **Indonesia’s BIG (Badan Informasi Geospasial)**: Indonesia's Geospatial Information Agency uses GeoServer to publish and share geospatial datasets that support management and planning activities related to development, disaster management, and environmental monitoring.

* 15. **Mexico’s National Biodiversity Information System (Sistema Nacional de Información sobre Biodiversidad - SNIB)**: Managed by the National Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO), GeoServer is used to publish biodiversity and environmental data to support conservation efforts.
