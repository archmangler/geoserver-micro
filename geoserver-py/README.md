# Installing Geoserver-py:

```

# Compared to other geoserver python libraries

* According to the project README:

```
There are several alternatives to this package, some of them are:

geoserver-rest is a Python library for management for geospatial data in GeoServer.
geoserver-restconfig is a python library for manipulating a GeoServer instance via the GeoServer RESTConfig API.
While these packages are great and well-maintained, they do not provide full type hints and customizations over the GeoServer REST API. This library aims to provide a closer API to the GeoServer REST API, making it easier to work with the package.

We would like to thank the authors of these packages for their contributions to the community, which have inspired us to create geoserver-py.
``` 

* However, our assessment is that both these libraries are falling out of maintenance and are more difficult to install and get working overall and are not as well documented.
